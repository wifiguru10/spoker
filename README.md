# spoker
Spoker is a script that'll help configure Meraki Auto-VPN Spokes. The script will take a input of HUBS and will map appropriate HUB priorities based on network TAGS. So you can adjust spoke load-balancing across geographically tagged networks. This is also a good way to add or remove hubs from existing networks.
